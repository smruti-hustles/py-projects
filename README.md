Here are some basic and amazing Python projects.

The first project is an ML project. It’s basically a webpage which
predicts the survival rate of a person. And we have
developed this using streamlit and scikit.

The second one  is a simple GUI based project which we all used to
play in our childhood and we have developed using python
tkinter.

Finally, the 3rd project is an amazing desktop
Virtual Assistant – Eli. Today’s technology is
all about AI, ChatBots, Virtual assistants etc.
So we have thought of making one. Because
of python we could make it very easily.
